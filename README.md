About the game:

The objective of the game is to be placed in the OSK store kiosk at the Via Parque shopping mall in Rio de Janeiro. The game will be played by children, who will explore the game map and win prizes during the exploration. The protagonist is the store mascot called "Osquinho". The game will be an RPG based on Minecraft, which will allow children to break trees to collect wood, use a fishing rod to catch items, and collect carrots throughout the game.

In addition to scattered and hidden sweets that will be given to each child when they find them.

The game will be an RPG, with a story still being scripted, and therefore will have a combat system smoothed out due to the age range of the game, where our protagonist will attack some villains.
